## Dice Game

## Introduction
This project is a dice game developed by IOOuterActive, a team of students from DTU. The game is designed for two players and can be played on DTUâ€™s databar machines without noticeable delays. Players take turns rolling two dice and land on a field with numbers from 2 to 12, each having a positive or negative effect on their money balance. The game ends when a player reaches 3000.

## Game Rules
- Players start with a balance of 1000.
- Players roll two dice by typing 'r' in the console and land on a field numbered 2 to 12.
- Each field has a specific effect on the player's balance:
  - **2: Tower** (+250)
  - **3: Crater** (-100)
  - **4: Palace Gates** (+100)
  - **5: Cold Desert** (-20)
  - **6: Walled City** (+180)
  - **7: Monastery** (0)
  - **8: Black Cave** (-70)
  - **9: Huts in the Mountain** (+60)
  - **10: The Werewall** (-80, but the player gets an extra turn)
  - **11: The Pit** (-50)
  - **12: Goldmine** (+650)
- The game ends when a player reaches a balance of 3000.
